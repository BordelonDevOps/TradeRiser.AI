# AWS Amplify Deployment Solution for TradeRiser.AI

## ‚ùå Current Problem
AWS Amplify **Hosting** is designed for **static websites only** (HTML, CSS, JS), not Python Flask servers. Your Flask backend cannot run on AWS Amplify Hosting.

## ‚úÖ Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: AWS Elastic Beanstalk (Recommended)
**Best for Python Flask applications**

1. **Create Elastic Beanstalk Application:**
   ```bash
   # Install EB CLI
   pip install awsebcli
   
   # Initialize EB in your project
   eb init
   
   # Create environment and deploy
   eb create traderiser-prod
   eb deploy
   ```

2. **Your files are already ready:**
   - ‚úÖ `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
   - ‚úÖ `Procfile` - Waitress server config
   - ‚úÖ `application.py` - Flask app

### Option 2: Railway (Easiest)
**Simple deployment platform**

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Railway auto-detects Python and deploys
4. Your app will be live in minutes

### Option 3: Render (Free tier available)
**Good alternative to Heroku**

1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Connect GitHub repository
3. Choose "Web Service"
4. Build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Start command: `waitress-serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=$PORT application:app`

### Option 4: AWS Lambda + API Gateway
**Serverless approach**

1. Use AWS SAM or Serverless Framework
2. Convert Flask routes to Lambda functions
3. More complex but highly scalable

## üö´ Why AWS Amplify Hosting Won't Work

- **Amplify Hosting** = Static websites (React, Vue, Angular)
- **Amplify Backend** = Different service for APIs/databases
- Your Flask app needs a **server environment**, not static hosting

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Choose Option 1 (Elastic Beanstalk)** for best AWS integration
2. **Choose Option 2 (Railway)** for fastest deployment
3. Keep your current files - they're configured correctly
4. Your local Flask app works perfectly, just needs proper hosting

## üîß Current File Status
- ‚úÖ Flask app runs locally on http://127.0.0.1:5001
- ‚úÖ All dependencies in requirements.txt
- ‚úÖ Waitress server configured
- ‚úÖ Ready for proper Python hosting platform

**Recommendation: Deploy to Railway.app for immediate results!**
