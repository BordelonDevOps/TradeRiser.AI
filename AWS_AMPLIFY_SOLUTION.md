# TradeRiser.AI Deployment Solutions

## 🚨 AWS Amplify Issue Resolved
**AWS Amplify Hosting cannot run Python Flask servers** - it's only for static websites. Your deployment failures were due to platform incompatibility, not your code.

## ✅ Working Deployment Options

### Option 1: Render.com (⚡ RECOMMENDED - Most Reliable)
**Best Flask deployment platform with excellent support**

1. **Go to [render.com](https://render.com)**
2. **Sign up with GitHub**
3. **Click "New" → "Web Service"**
4. **Connect your GitHub repository**
5. **Configure:**
   - **Build Command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command:** `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT application:application`
   - **Environment:** Python 3
6. **Deploy automatically**

**Why Render.com is best:**
- ✅ Excellent Flask support
- ✅ Reliable deployments
- ✅ Free tier with 750 hours/month
- ✅ Automatic HTTPS
- ✅ Easy environment variables
- ✅ Better error handling than Railway

### Option 2: AWS Elastic Beanstalk (Manual Setup)
**AWS EB CLI has Windows compatibility issues, use AWS Console instead**

#### **Step 1: Prepare Your Code**
Your files are already perfect:
- ✅ `application.py` - Flask app
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
- ✅ `Procfile` - Waitress server config

#### **Step 2: Create ZIP Package**
```bash
# Create deployment package (exclude unnecessary files)
zip -r traderiser-deployment.zip . -x "*.git*" "__pycache__*" "*.pyc" "node_modules*" ".env*"
```

#### **Step 3: Deploy via AWS Console**
1. **Go to [AWS Elastic Beanstalk Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/)**
2. **Click "Create Application"**
3. **Application name:** `TradeRiser-AI`
4. **Platform:** `Python`
5. **Platform version:** `Python 3.11 running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2023`
6. **Upload your ZIP file**
7. **Click "Create application"**

#### **Step 4: Configure Environment Variables**
In EB Console → Configuration → Software:
- Add your API keys and environment variables
- Set `FLASK_ENV=production`

### Option 3: Render.com (💰 FREE TIER)
**Good Heroku alternative**

1. **Go to [render.com](https://render.com)**
2. **Connect GitHub repository**
3. **Choose "Web Service"**
4. **Settings:**
   - **Build Command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command:** `waitress-serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=$PORT application:app`
   - **Environment:** `Python 3`

### Option 4: Vercel (You already have .vercel folder)
**Serverless deployment**

1. **Install Vercel CLI:** `npm install -g vercel`
2. **Run:** `vercel`
3. **Follow prompts**

## 🎯 Final Recommendation

- ✅ Most reliable Flask deployment platform
- ✅ Superior error handling and debugging
